Stack Overflow has recently announced a new feature they're working on, [**Channels**](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/07/11/introducing-channels-private-qa-team/), for teams that need a dedicated, **private** space to share knowledge. Stack Overflow has established itself as a primary knowledge hub among software developers, but until now (most of) the exchanged knowledge was public. This seems like a logical next step for Stack Exchange, but it may risk splitting the community and potentially hindering knowledge curation.

![Private channels alongside the public Q&A on Stack Overflow - alpha testing version](/assets/article_images/2017-11-10-towards-stack-overflow-channels/so_channels.gif "Private channels alongside the public Q&A on Stack Overflow")

As a researcher who's keen on understanding how developers use Stack Overflow, I reflect on the impact these private channels may have on the knowledge curation processes *at the community level*. Note that my reflection is based on the information provided so far---Stack Overflow's development team seems to be a bit [overwhelmed](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/358943/what-s-happening-with-channels) by the interest generated by their initial announcement, but gradually they've been [releasing updates on the design process](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/11/09/why-channels/). I hope this will be of help to the community.
 
## Bridging A Gap
between public Q&A and large organizations Q&A

## Fragmentation of Knowledge

Currently, the development community is united in a single channel, and is only fragmented by the tags (excluding the enterprise edition which is used privately). However, if many small and private channels are created, will this fragment the knowledge on StackOverflow into small sub-communities?

One of the strengths of StackOverflow is that it has so much accumulated and curated knowledge. There is a high chance that most frequent questions were already answered with multiple possible solutions. We may take this for granted, but imagine a company that decided to create their own StackOverflow. Unless it has a large starting knowledge base, it will probably won't be very useful.

## Norms and Rules

More importantly, each private channels will have their own moderation rules and norms (as stated in the StackOverflow announcement). On one hand it may mean that people who didn't agree with the current StackOverflow norms (e.g., allowing off-topic questions) can now create their own sub-communities and shape the norms. From the other hand, it means that many of these channels may end up having norms and rules that people may not agree with (e.g., being less accessible to women).

## Moderation and Community Caretakers

Another possible issue, is finding moderators and community caretakers that would ensure high quality knowledge curation and adherence to the norms. Already now, prior to the introduction of private channels, moderators and community caretakers are few in numbers and struggle with the amount of work (see our MSR EMSE paper). Will these new sub-communities be able to find members to fill these roles?

## Gamification and Effort-vs.-Value

The current plan is that:
>_When you operate within a channel, all of the privileges you earn (including reputation, etc) remain specific to that channel, where your ability to contribute will grow over time, depending on how the channel is configured._
>_Folks that belong to channels will be able to search content from a single location, but reputation, privileges and moderation access within a channel won't carry over to public Q&A._

How will this affect gamification and people willingness to answer question. Will people be interested in contributing in private channels where they earn "local reputation points" or will they prefer to go for the public Q&A and earn "global reputation points"? Time will tell, how this mechanism will work. Furthermore, this opens a door for abuse and cheating (e.g., using private channels to accumulate fake reputation points, or reposting private questions and answers to gain double points).

## The Experiment

It seems StackOverflow aim this to be a paid feature (similar to the Enterprise edition of StackOverflow), but it may end up being a very interesting experiment on what makes StackOverflow successful and how can it be replicated to work for smaller communities and assemblages. I only hope it won't be at the cost of the existing successful role of StackOverflow in the knowledge curation process.

## Is StackOverflow Succeeds Because of The Technological Design or Its Community?

There is no denying that StackOverflow is an extremely successful tool for many developers and knowledge workers. But what is responsible for this success? If it is the technology and the design (e.g., ability to upvote questions, reputation points, etc...), then it means that introducing private channels shouldn't impact the current knowledge sharing activities on StackOverflow. That's because the new private channels would use the exact same design and tools for the private channels.

But what if the success of StackOverflow is less about the design and technology, and more about uniting communities of developers and providing a shared space for knowledge curation and sharing. In that case, splitting the development community into sub-communities may introduce various challenges.
