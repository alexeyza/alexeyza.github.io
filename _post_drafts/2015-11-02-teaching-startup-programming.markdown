Startups are challenging, thrilling, frustrating, and scary - all at the same time. Learning how to create a startup is extremely beneficial to computer science students, even if they don't necessarily plan to create their own startup in the future. It allows students to employ and combine all the knowledge gained so far, and acquire the skills needed to succeed in the modern software world, through hands-on experience.

"Self-reflection is the capacity of humans to exercise introspection and the willingness to learn more about their fundamental nature, purpose and essence."

As part of the final assignment at the [Startup Programming](https://github.com/alexeyza/startup-programming) course, which I'm co-teaching, students are asked to write a personal reflection. I decided to do the same, and write up my own reflections and thoughts on the course.

## From Google Workshop to Startup Programming
Startup Programming is a project-based course, that aims to give students the tools and skills to rapidly develop and transform innovative ideas into working projects utilizing advanced mobile, social, cloud, and web technologies. In particular, students experience the style of development activity that is common in a new startup company. The course is augmented by a series of lectures to accelerate learning with new web technologies, product design, agile development practices, user interface design, and project management.

Startup Programming is a newly run course at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/), and is based on a course I was previously co-teaching - The [Google Technologies for Cloud and Web Development Workshop](https://sites.google.com/site/cloudweb11b/Home). The original course was first introduced at Tel Aviv University in 2007 as an Internet Technologies course, that started with small projects (mostly based on the iGoogle Gadget technology) and with small teams of 2 students per team. The course has taken its more current form in 2008, when [Yossi Matias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yossi_Matias) has invited Googlers as mentors in the course. I joined the course teaching staff in 2010.

## What is Startup Programming?
The course begins with a few introductory meetings, and then switches to guest talks and student presentation meetings.

How did startup programming works (what it consists of, etc...). mention importance of validation and metrics (include ash mayura tweet quote - which i sent to Leif as well).
