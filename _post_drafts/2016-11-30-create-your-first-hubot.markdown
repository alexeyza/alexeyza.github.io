## Create a Local Bot
First, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed by typing `node --version` or `which node` in the command line. If Node.js is not installed, please [install Node.js](/blog/2015/09/28/getting-started-with-node-dot-js/) before continuing with this guide.

Next, install Hubot to your local machine. Please follow [the official documentation](https://hubot.github.com/docs/) up to the section that talks about *scripts*.

## Configure Hubot to Use Slack
Hubot can work with [many different adapters](https://hubot.github.com/docs/adapters/), and in this guide we'll use the Slack adapter.

If you used `yo` to install Hubot (as described in the official documentation), just type

```bash
yo hubot --adapter=slack
```

and it will prompt you to describe the bot you're going to build.
