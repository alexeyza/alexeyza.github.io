Reporting and reviewing empirical work in software engineering is a challenging task. Reviews are often faced with important questions: What aspects of an empirical study should they focus on? How should they review the contributions of empirical work? What kind of empirical evidence yields reliable conclusions? How should they examine and review statistical analysis in the context of software engineering?

In this short post, I gather helpful information that may assist authors and reviewers in the reviewing process.
