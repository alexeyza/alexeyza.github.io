I'm a software engineering researcher who's passionate about startups, UX, and entrepreneurship. Currently I'm in the final stages of a PhD in computer science. My research focuses on software engineering, studying the interplay between developers, tools, their activities, and how this interplay affects collaboration and communication---i.e.,*"we shape our tools and our tools shape us"*. Specifically, I explore how developers, communities, and organizations build and share knowledge, and how their tools support (or hinder) this process.
