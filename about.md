I'm a software engineering researcher who's passionate about startups, UX, and entrepreneurship. Currently I'm in the final stages of a PhD in computer science. My research focuses on software engineering, studying the interplay between developers, tools, their activities, and how this interplay affects collaboration and communication---i.e.,*"we shape our tools and our tools shape us"*. Specifically, I explore how developers, communities, and organizations build and share knowledge, and how their tools support (or hinder) this process.

I've spent six years studying developers and how they work, conducting surveys, interviews, focus groups, case studies, observations, lab experiments, and mining archival data (including data from Stack Overflow and GitHub). A key factor of my work looks at the socio-technical perspective, recognizing not only the human-computer interactions, but also interactions of groups and communities with technology. I give back to the community by regularly publishing and disseminating our research through blog posts, academic papers, journals, and conferences.

I believe that *"a 10x engineer isn't someone who is 10x better than those around them, but someone who makes those around them 10x better"*. In my current role, I've led, mentored, and managed many awesome PhD and Master's students, and had my hands in numerous projects outside of my own research.

I am also deeply passionate about startups, UX, and entrepreneurship. As a result, I've been taking part in teaching and community activities that help build products people love. I designed and taught nine iterations of *Startup Programming*, a project-based course where students learn to build innovative web and mobile products for real users. I also helped teach an HCI course. These experiences have taught me a lot about human-centered perspective and interaction design. I have learned how to critically evaluate product designs, how to communicate and provide feedback and guidance towards improving a product, how to guide and mentor others, and how to oversee and manage multiple projects. I've also been very fortunate to meet and learn from many entrepreneurs, developers, UX/UI designers, and product managers.

My research work is done under the guidance of [Margaret-Anne Storey](http://margaretstorey.com/). Prior to that, I was fortunate to work with [Amiram Yehudai](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~amiramy/) and [Ohad Barzilay](http://www.barzilab.com/).
