I'm a Ph.D. candidate under the guidance of [Margaret-Anne Storey](http://margaretstorey.com/) at the University of Victoria and a member of [the CHISEL group](http://thechiselgroup.org/). I focus on software engineering, studying the interplay between developers, tools, their activities, and how it affects collaboration and communication. My current research aims to form a _theory of knowledge_ in software engineering. 

Prior to that, under the guidance of [Amiram Yehudai](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~amiramy/) and the mentorship of [Ohad Barzilay](http://www.barzilab.com/), I studied _opportunistic software development_ by building and evaluating a social media code recommendation system.

During summer of 2016, I've visited the Software Engineering Research Group ([SERG](http://swerl.tudelft.nl/bin/view/Main/WebHome)) at Delft University of Technology.

I'm also very much interested in early-stage startups.
