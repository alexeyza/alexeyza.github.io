This is a post about challenges I encountered when we used Slack. This is NOT based on a research study, but is based on my own personal experience.

## Context: How was slack used in our course?
106 students
weekly class meetings + lab meetings (4 labs)
1 instructor, 2 TAs
HCI course (with assignments, exam, and design project)
January 2016 (before Slack supported threaded messaging)

27 channels
- Various team channels
- #assignment-tips
- #midterm
- #class-activities
- #coolreads
- #final-questions
- #general
- #lab
- #midterm-questions
- #milestone1-feedback
- #project-videos
- #random

Students were allowed to open new channels (public + private), and to add integrations. We used the free version of Slack (which is limited in the amount of messages it displays and searches through).
No bots used (neither by teaching staff, nor by students - give some examples. mostly because there were not many at the time that we found useful)

Slack was used only to accommodate communication, and facilitate discussion -  used Slack for communication, but for urgent communication, we used email as well. During lectures, students would post comments and questions in Slack (displayed on a second projector). During labs, students would share their solutions and designs with other students (in same lab, and between labs)
Between classes, students would use Slack for discussions and questions. We used it to also share extra reading material with students.

## Keeping awareness
Example of a channel created that was important but I didn't know even existed only until later (#assignment-tips).

## Dealing with scale, communication overload
There was definitely more communication compared to other courses (even where we had more students). We didn't actually compare this course to other courses in terms of numbers, but there was higher activity/engagement.
However, this also created a situation where I couldn't actually read all the messages posted in the public channels. I setup that I would be notified any time students mentioned my name (this allowed me to join the conversation every time they mentioned my name). I asked the students to mention my name (or my @username to make sure I get notified if they need my attention to something).

Emoji's were used extensively by students (though at the time, each emoji was a message in it's own).
We reached the 10k message limit quite quickly.

## Benefits of using Slack:
- Improved engagement
- Allowed students to share their solutions and designs, and provide feedback to each other (beyond 1-to-1)
- Allowed more quite (introvert) students to join class discussions.
