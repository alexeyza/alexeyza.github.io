As a researcher and a member of the [CHISEL research group](http://thechiselgroup.org/), I use many software tools on a regular basis that I find useful.

### Writing and Collaborating on Papers

For writing papers, I use [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) with the [LaTeXTools](https://latextools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package installed. This allows me to edit and compile the document directly from ST3. I have the exact same setup with the [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor as well, and both work well.

For collaborating on papers, I prefer to use [GitHub](https://github.com/) and host the source files (e.g., `tex`,`bib`) in a repository dedicated for the paper. I believe this gives each co-author the freedom to choose and set up their own work environment and tools (as opposed to something like [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/)).

Typically when starting to work on a paper, we use [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) to draft out an outline for the paper and reach an agreement on the direction of the paper. The commenting mechanism on Google Docs works well and supports brainstorming.

Other tools I typically use:

- [LatexDiff](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexdiff), a command line tool, for generating visual diffs between compiled documents. Very useful when outlining changes to reviewers between revisions. Similarly, [Git-LatexDiff](https://gitlab.com/git-latexdiff/git-latexdiff) aims to generate a diff and simplify the process even further
- [AbstractFormater](https://abstractformatter.inventitech.com/) for formating text. Very useful, especially for paper submissions
- [BibTex normalizer](https://hsborges.github.io/bibtex-normalizer/) for cleaning up the bibtex file
- [EZProxy plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ezproxy-redirect/gfhnhcbpnnnlefhobdnmhenofhfnnfhi?hl=en) for accessing academic papers from outside of the university's network
- [Octobox](https://octobox.io/) for managing GitHub notifications

### Preprints and Study Data Sharing

- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/): for sharing data from our studies (e.g., replication package)
- [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/): for preprints or papers that are not archived elsewhere

### Team Communication

- [Slack](https://slack.com/): most of our group's communication happens on Slack, though we may switch to [Mattermost](https://about.mattermost.com/) later this year
- [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/): video calls when we're not co-located
- Email

### Schedule

- [Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar): we share a group calendar to coordinate our schedule

### Keeping Up To Date

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) + [Buffer](https://buffer.com/): following research-related people and products. I try to keep the number of people I follow at a manageable number (~150)
- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/) updates and alerts
- [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/news)
- [Feedly](https://feedly.com/): to keep up with blogs (e.g., [http://blog.ieeesoftware.org/](http://blog.ieeesoftware.org/)) and tech news
- [Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&hl=en): I subscribe to helpful and related podcasts (e.g., [https://changelog.com/rfc](https://changelog.com/rfc))
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/): following research-related people and channels

### Knowledge Management and To-Dos

- GitHub + Markdown files
- [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/)
- [Trello](https://trello.com/)

### Presentation Slides

- [Google Slides](https://www.google.ca/slides/about/): for creating slides. I also use Google slides as a brainstorming tool when starting to design a study/paper
- [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/): for sharing my slides
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) / [Unspalsh](https://unsplash.com/) / [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)

### Posters

### Collecting Data from Surveys and Interviews

- [Google Forms](https://www.google.ca/forms/about/): for conducting surveys
- [Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)](https://obsproject.com/): for recording interviews. The benefit of using OBS is that it works with any communication channel (Skype, Google Hangouts, etc...)

### Data Analysis

- [RQDA](http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/): for qualitative data analysis (coding, memoing, generating themes)

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/): for working with REST APIs (better than Postman)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/): for deploying projects

### App / Tool Design

- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/): for low-fidelity mockups
- [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/): for interaction design
