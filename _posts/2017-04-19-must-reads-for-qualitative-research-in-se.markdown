What papers and books would you consider as *must-reads* for software engineering researchers, especially for researchers that do qualitative studies? Here is *my list* of readings that I feel are important, seminal, or fundamental for conducting, communicating, and understanding software engineering research. In my opinion, each one of these provides important aspects.

There are many other recommended papers and books (too many to fit in a single blog post), so I tried to list the papers that should apply to most researchers. Have I forgotten to mention an important paper? Please let me know.

What papers or books do **you** feel are *must-reads*?  
What would **you** recommend to new software engineering grad students?
