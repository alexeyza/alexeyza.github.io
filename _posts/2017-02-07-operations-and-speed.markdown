In the wonderful and demanding reality of startups, you may find yourself working hard, for many hours, feeling busy, but actually accomplishing little and barely "moving the needle". Operations is not about the hours spent, instead on how you work and which things you choose to work on. Many people see two dimensions here: **Strategy** and **Execution**. For early stage startups, execution is more about speed, while the strategy is about quality. Speed increases your chances of success, and gives you more opportunities for learning before you run out resources.

It's very common to find yourself working on many things that don't move the needle, so to speak (e.g., refactoring, improving architecture, long term improvements), but actually this can be a critical mistake for early stage startups (pre seed, round A). It's important to focus on doing things that "move the needle".

Consider the **unit of execution** you aim for (e.g., 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month) - how often will you do something that moves the needle? This will dictate your work and decision making. A good rule of thumb, is perhaps to aim for the company to do something that moves the needle at least once a week or once every two weeks (in fact, ideally each team member should contribute something that moves the needle in that time frame). If this doesn't happen: there may be a problem with your strategy or with the specific team member.

Startups tackle big problems, but it's very hard to tackle the whole problem. Typically, these big problems consist of many smaller things - so choosing on what to focus is critical. Equally important is to be able **gauge your speed**.

## Tools and Practices that Help with Speed

- **Culture of shipping**
- Infrastructure that supports **continuous deployment and shipping**
- **Efficient decision making process:** sometimes people believe they have to do more research on the topic, that they don't have enough input, that they need to reach agreement or consensus in the team --- eventually ending up delaying the decision. In most cases, it's better to make a decision and change your mind later, than not making a decision
- **Focus:** work on most important thing. Dissemble the most important thing to it's basic layers, and focus on the most important one
- **Delegation and ownership**: allow people in your team to take decisions without the need to seek agreement with everyone

These insights are based on a [podcast discussion](http://www.shavua.net/307) by [Eytan Levit](https://twitter.com/eytanlevit) and [David Katz](https://twitter.com/_dkatz) (original podcast is in Hebrew). Initially, I summarized these insights to share with my students at the [Startup Programming course](https://github.com/alexeyza/startup-programming), and later decided to share it here too.
