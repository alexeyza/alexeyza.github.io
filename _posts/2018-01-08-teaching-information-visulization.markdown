I see information visualization as one of the most fascinating and important areas, particularly useful for researchers and people who work with data. From cases like [Charles Minard's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard) map of Napoleon's campaign of 1812, and [John Snow's cholera outbreak  map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak) of London 1854, we can see examples how visual articulation of data can impact the world. If I were to teach an InfoVis course, I would use the following material and tools.

## Books

I can't think of a specific book that can serve as the course textbook. Hence, I'm recommending multiple sources of material.

![Charles Minard's map of Napoleon's disastrous Russian campaign of 1812. The graphic is notable for its representation in two dimensions of six types of data: the number of Napoleon's troops; distance; temperature; the latitude and longitude; direction of travel; and location relative to specific dates. (source: Wikipedia)](/assets/article_images/2018-01-08-teaching-information-visulization/minard_lg.gif "Minard's map of Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812")

One book that's worth covering is Edward Tufte's ["The Visual Display of Quantitative Information"](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) book. It focuses on comprehensible and usable design, concisely and clearly articulating core principles. It includes many good examples (including examples of poor design).

>"Graphical excellence is the well-designed presentation of interesting data---a matter of substance, of statistics, and of design."

>--- Edward R. Tufte"

Tamara Munzner's book, ["Visualization Analysis and Design"](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/vadbook/), does a great job in providing and framing the proper terminology for learning about and discussing InfoVis topics (Figure 2.1 of the book shows a summary of this framework). While, Tamara's book would work great as a reference book, I don't think it should be used as the only textbook.

Additional material that may be worth covering or providing as recommended reading: ["Envisioning Information"](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_ei) by Edward Tufte, ["Visual Thinking for Design"](https://www.amazon.com/Visual-Thinking-Design-Colin-Ware/dp/0123708966) by Colin Ware, and ["The Functional Art"](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/) by Alberto Cairo.  
For aspects of interaction, the paper ["Toward a Deeper Understanding of the Role of Interaction in Information Visualization"](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1313151) may serve as a helpful starting point (by Yi _et al._ 2007).

Additionally, I suggest taking a look at the interesting [story of William Playfair](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-scottish-scoundrel-who-changed-how-we-see-data), the inventor of the pie chart, the bar graph, and the line graph. [Eugene Wei's depiction of his job at Amazon](http://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2017/11/13/remove-the-legend) as the first analyst in the strategic planning department is also worth reading.

No matter what kind of data needs to be visualized, an important question to ask oneself is: are you *communicating information*, *displaying an analysis*, or *exploring data*? For instance, Scott Berinato described [four types of visual communication](https://hbr.org/2016/06/visualizations-that-really-work) (idea illustration, idea generation, visual discovery, and everyday dataviz). Even something as basic as a table can be improved---not by adding more visual cues, but [by removing unnecessary visual clutter](http://www.darkhorseanalytics.com/blog/clear-off-the-table).

For more modern examples, the ["Information is Beautiful" Awards](https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase?award=2017&type=awards) website showcases interesting award winning examples. These projects were awarded for excellence and beauty in data visualizations.

## Software and Tools

These are commonly used tools that I find useful:

- Visualizations with R and [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) (and packages like [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/)). Related to visualizations in R, check out the book ["Circular Visualization in R"](http://zuguang.de/circlize_book/book/)
- The [D3.js library](https://d3js.org/) and the ["D3.js in Action" book](https://medium.com/@Elijah_Meeks/d3-js-in-action-second-edition-8cf7ffa2a116): D3 is a great JS library for creating visualizations. It's commonly used and is very customizable. Related to D3, the book ["Interactive Data Visualization for the Web"](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/index.html) by Scott Murray is exceptionally good (and very practical).
- Tableau or [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/s/)


## Inspirational People in the Field

[Giorgia Lupi](http://giorgialupi.com/) is an award winning information designer. I find her work to be inspirational and superb. I highly recommend her [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/giorgia_lupi_how_we_can_find_ourselves_in_data).

[Nadieh Bremer](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/) is an award-winning data visualization designer, with an interesting background as an astronomer and a data scientist. Interestingly, she has shared [a list of resources](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/resources/visualization-resources) and [a compilation of recommended books](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/resources/learning-data-visualization/books), with a short review and her thoughts on the usefulness of each book. If you wish to learn more about data visualization, I recommend checking it out.

I'd love to add additional material that can be of help to others. If you've taught or taken an InfoVis course---what material did **you** use or have found useful?
